Here is my 2 cents!
I have been trying to use the same project folder when my first submit is not successful and I am given a new Repo. ( I didn’t necessarily wanted just to use git clone.
Here is an example for libft project:

Stuck standard set up is as below:
I have Libft folder
I have local git on libft folder
I have remote git for libft folder

I failed the first Libft due to Makefile was not Capital, now I have a new Git Repository.
I would like to use the existing libft folder and files and just link it to the new Repo.

I found the below steps covers that process and also along the way does some checks.
All the below commands have been used while in libft folder

Git remote -v (shows the current git Repo address and since I had submitted the project I no longer have push access to it)
You would see similar 2 lines as shown below
origin	git@vogsphere.42adel.org.au:vogsphere/intra-uuid-………… (fetch)
origin	git@vogsphere.42adel.org.au:vogsphere/intra-uuid-…………. (push)

I discovered the name origin is actually an alias for the full URL address! and it could be set as anything

Now first I need to remove the current link by using the below command:

Git remote rm origin ( remember origin actually means the full URL address)
Then if you type again
Git remote -v ( you should not see anything, as the link is now removed)

Now to link the new address:
Git remote add origin < new URL address>. ( as mentioned above this command also sets the URL address to the alias origin)

This links your folder to the new URL, however there is nothing in it as yet and we need to git push

If you type git push it will give you an error message with the exact command you need to type to push the info upstream

git push --set-upstream origin master
The screen will show the activities taking place to upload the files.
